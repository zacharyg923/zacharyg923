ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zach! (@zacharyg923)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in: UX/UI/Web design and development, social justice/advocacy, music, animals, video games, reading, writing, journaling, and travelling!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: I just started learning HTML and CSS, but eventually I want to learn all sorts of coding languages! I want to learn anything and everything to do with UX/UI/Web design and development (primarily front-end, but I'd like to learn full-stack development too)!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can shoot me an email (zacharygoodpaster923@gmail.com) or send me a message on LinkedIn! The link to my LinkedIn profile is in my GitHub profile :)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I graduated from Arizona State University with a B.A. in Psychology in December 2023, and recently went back to start my B.S. in GIT (Graphic Information Technology) in January! I'm expected to graduate in late 2025-early 2026!
